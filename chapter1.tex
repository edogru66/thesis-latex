- Early History (Darwin Mendel Identification of DNA etc.)

It all started with Darwin's book of The Origins of Species, which he published in 1859. Since then, the field of genomics have been paid a great deal of attention. What Darwin argues in his book is that animals that is more resilient to the environmental conditions contributed more to the genetic hereditary. In those years, there was an Augustinian monk whose name was Gregor Mendel was conducting experiments on his monastery's garden. His experiments were different than that of Darwin's, since Mendel has done his experiments in a more systematic way. Mendel used pea plants to observe how the genetic hereditary passes down to younger generations. He crossbred the different pea plants each of which has different traits. Then he made two important observation. One of them is that some traits appear more than others and the second is even if a trait is no longer observed in one generation, it may reappear later in the offspring. His barely appreciated work at that time has earned him the title ``Father of Genetics".

A few years after the Mendel's experiments, Friedrich Miescher, a Swiss biochemist, have isolated what he called at that time ``nuclein" since it comes from the cell nucleus. In 1874, Miescher has successfully separated the ``nuclein" into protein and acid, and therefore the term ``nuclein" was later changed into nucleic acid, which is what we call it today\cite{pray2008discovery}.

In 1953, there was a breakthrough in the field of genetics with the discovery of double helix structure of DNA by James Watson and Francis Crick. Watson and Crick had answered the biggest question till then in genetics that could lead to solving the mystery about genetic heredity. In a series of articles published in several journals, Watson et al., apart from exposing the structure of DNA, have put their findings together with those of other researchers and come up with a mechanism for DNA replication along with three pieces of evidence supporting the complementary model\cite{watson1953structure}.

Having identified the structure of DNA, Frederick Sanger and Alan Coulson have developed the ``plus and minus" method, which is widely known as Sanger sequencing, for rapidly determining the order of smallest genetic units in DNA\cite{sanger1975rapid}. In an article published in 1970, Sanger et al. have set the gold standard in sequencing. They used DNA polymerase, an enzyme that is essential for DNA replication, to generate template DNA strands, all of which should start in the same exact position and end in normally one base larger (or smaller) than the previous. Sanger was able to stop the polymerase by removing an oxygen from the nucleotide at which he wants to stop. Sanger made these DNA sequences move at various speed under an electrical field. The speed of the DNA sequence is inversely proportional to its weight.
